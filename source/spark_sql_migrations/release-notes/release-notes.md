## Version 1.9.1

- Adding schema to the Views.

### Changes

Every View in the `schema_config` file can now have a schema defined. It is optional for now.

It can be used to test that the views have the expected schema with unit tests.

Example:

``` python
  views=[
      View(name="test_view", schema=test_view_schema)
  ]
```
